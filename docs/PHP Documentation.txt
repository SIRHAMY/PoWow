getCatQuestions.php
===================
Returns questions in chosen category from DB (default number is 5)

Place params in URL as BASEURL/getCatQuestion.php?qCategory=INSERTCATNAMEHERE

Params
qCategory=[Input Desired Category as listed in DB Architecture]
qLongitude //Place holders for later geographic algorithm implementation
qLatitude

pushQuestion.php
================
Pushes a question to the DB.  I think all of these parameters have to be included in the URL for the file not to crash, so if you don't want to use one just put NULL in it -> also assuming the DB will know that "NULL" is NULL and not "NULL"

askerID - The asker's unique ID
qCategory - The category you want the question to be posted under
qText - The title of the question
qDescription - Any additional text for the question
